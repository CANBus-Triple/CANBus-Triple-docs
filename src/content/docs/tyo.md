title: TYO Mag
---
TYO Mag is an online arts and literary magazine featuring artwork from Japanese artists and foreign artists working in Japan. As my co-editor, Kris Hartrum, and I originally conceived TYO, it is meant to help connect those creating art in Tokyo to the outside art world (especially the non-Japanese speaking art world).

In developing the site, I placed a premium on readability across all devices. A very significant portion of our audience finds TYO through social media, and often, that's on their phones. So the issues are fully responsive.
